        Cryptocurrencies require a platform that is secure, trustworthy, and fully under your control. 
        That’s why we don’t offer a web or mobile app—they’re inherently insecure and often subject to outside control.

            <p>
                Our software runs locally on Linux, Windows, and macOS—no cloud, no third-party tracking.
                You remain in full control: your data cannot be accessed, seen, or intercepted by anyone else.
                All sensitive information, including private keys, transactions, and settings, is stored in encrypted databases on your machine.

            <p>
                We don’t ask for your email, phone number, passport or ID. You simply launch the app and create local databases.
                Unlike other platforms, there's no sign-up process and no server-side identity.

            <p>
                Everything runs on your device—no syncing, no uploads, no surveillance. All critical data is sealed in an encrypted vault file that only you control.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Why Off-Chain Isn't Sovereign</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">
            Centralized platforms like Kraken or Binance often settle trades off-chain—inside private databases rather than on the blockchain.
            This creates hidden risks: transactions may be frozen, reversed, or disclosed without your consent.
            <br><br>
            XIUM ensures every transaction is processed <strong>on-chain</strong>, giving you full visibility and control.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">OECD CARF: Global Crypto Reporting Begins 2026</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">
            Starting <strong>January 1st, 2026</strong>, the OECD's Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) will require platforms operating in the EU and over 40 countries to report user transactions to tax authorities.
            <br><br>
            Most off-chain providers will be subject to this—by design.
            Our app is different: it doesn't collect personal data, and your encrypted data never leaves your device.
            <br><br>
            You remain independent—even under evolving regulation.
